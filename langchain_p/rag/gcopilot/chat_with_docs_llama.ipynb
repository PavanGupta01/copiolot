We consider ethical conduct to be conduct in conformance with accepted professional standards of conduct and compliance with all applicable laws.\\n\\nEthical conduct includes the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interests between professional and personal relations.\\n\\nConflict of Interests\\n\\nEmployees must avoid circumstances in which their personal interest may conflict or appear to conflict in the interest of the organization or its customers.\\n\\nA possible conflict of interest exists if an employee or his / her immediate family member having a direct or an indirect interest in any transaction or proposed transaction involving GAVS that might influence employee’s decision.\\n\\nEmployees publishing articles, blogs, white papers, participating in any forums, seminars, delivering speeches, etc., shall ensure that these contain nothing that is confidential or contains any information to which the employee has access by virtue of his or her role / association and / or explicitly convey views / information shared internally by the organization.\\n\\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\\n\\nProfessional relationships\\n\\nEmployees must maintain courteous, efficient and impartial relationship with one another. No personal biases should be allowed to affect working relationships. Close personal relationships should not be allowed to interfere with work.\\n\\nAppointment and other employment terms\\n\\nAppointments are always made on merit and not influenced by relationships or friendships. Employees should not try to influence decisions beneficial to their relatives or friends employed in GAVS.

It is the responsibility of employees to make sure that all assets in their control are maintained and handled with care. Employees are accountable for any misappropriate use or damage caused to the assets assigned to them.\\n\\nProtecting Company’s Confidential Information\\n\\nUnauthorized use or distribution of the company’s information is prohibited and could also be illegal and result in civil or criminal penalties. Furthermore, any employee opinion as published content or publicly made statement that might be perceived or construed as attributable to the company made outside the scope of his/her employment with GAVS must be reviewed and approved in writing in advance by Corporate Communications team. No financial information may be disclosed without prior approval from Finance department.\\n\\nSurfing and emails\\n\\nInternet access is provided to employees who are expected to use it primarily for work purposes. Employees must ensure that applications consuming high bandwidth do not disrupt the work of their peers. Company policy strictly prohibits access to unsolicited websites, and if an employee is not abiding by this policy, the employee is liable to face disciplinary action including termination.\\n\\nMoral Responsibility and Honesty\\n\\nAll are expected to deal with professional ethics and honesty with company's money, material, information and documents. Services of an individual found guilty of gross indiscipline, moral turpitude, fraud, misappropriation or any other act against the interest of the company may be dispensed with, without giving any prior notice. Disciplinary and / or legal action could also be initiated depending upon the gravity of situation.\\n\\nEmployment\\n\\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\\n\\nNo individual is allowed to work directly or indirectly for any other person, firm, company or organization whether with or without remuneration while in service with GAVS. No employee of GAVS shall engage himself/herself or be interested directly in any trade or business, whether as an employer or as an employee or partner or adviser or in any other capacity.\\n\\nTermination on account of conviction\\n\\nCompany shall have the right of immediate termination of employees services, if found, at any time, that the employee has been, or are convicted by a Court of Law or penal proceedings are initiated or pending against the employee before any Court of Law i) for offence(s) involving moral turpitude and / or ii) offence(s) of non-cognizable nature and/ or iii) for an offence(s) which is leading to punishable imprisonment and/ or iv) for an offence(s) which the Company considers that the same may be prejudicial to the interests of it and its reputation thereof.\\n\\nEducation/Higher studies\\n\\nAny individual wishing to pursue any kind of studies or wish to appear in any type of examination is required to obtain written permission from Business Head, giving full details of studies/examination, time frame involved and expected leave requirements.\\n\\nIntellectual Property\\n\\nAll personnel of GAVS are required to promptly disclose to it and assign to it, individual's interest in any invention, improvement or discovery made or conceived whether alone or jointly with others, which arises out of any proceedings relating to such invention, improvement or discovery and in obtaining domestic and foreign patent or other protection covering the same.\\n\\nDress Code\\n\\nSince each of us is a representative of GAVS, we must pay attention to personal grooming and adhere to the recommended dress code.

It also prohibits discrimination or harassment based on the perception that anyone has any of those characteristics, or is associated with a person who has or is perceived as having any of those characteristics.\\n\\nOver-riding effect of Code of Business Conduct and Ethics\\n\\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics is, at places, more restrictive than the applicable laws and regulations and employees are required to abide by Code of Business Conduct and Ethics even when it imposes requirements that go beyond legal obligations. If employees are uncertain of the legal requirements or if they believe that they are subject to conflicting legal obligations, they must bring this to the attention of the HR department.\\n\\n4.0 Acknowledgement\\n\\nEvery employee is expected to read, understand and acknowledge the above contents.\\n\\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\\n\\n5.0 Annexure\\n\\nFORM OF ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS\\n\\nI have received and read the company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.

The aim is to ensure prompt, consistent and fair treatment for all employees and to assist in enabling both the employees and GAVS to be clear about the expectations of both parties.\\n\\nThis procedure applies to all categories of employees at GAVS Technologies\\n\\nGeneral Principles\\n\\nThe following principles will apply to the application of this procedure:\\n\\nInformal Resolution - Reporting managers are responsible for addressing issues pertaining to conduct and behavior. Where necessary, steps will be taken to resolve issues on an informal basis without recourse to the formal procedure or for initiating appropriate action\\n\\nInvestigation - Before disciplinary action is taken an investigation shall be undertaken. Where the manager with authority to hear the case considers it appropriate the contents of an investigation undertaken under another procedure may be used as part of this process.\\n\\nNature of allegations - The employee against whom an allegation has been made shall be advised in writing of the nature of the allegations made against him/her and will be given the opportunity to state his/her case before any decision is made to take disciplinary action.\\n\\nFirst breach of discipline -Dismissal may also be a sanction for a first breach of discipline as per gravity of offence and discretion of the disciplinary committee.\\n\\nSuspension - At any stage in the procedure, if appropriate, an employee may be suspended. Suspension is not a penalty and is not an indication of culpability, there is therefore a presumption that suspension will be on half pay. The decision to suspend will be taken by the disciplinary committee.\\n\\nRight to be accompanied - All employees who are the subject of this procedure have the right to be accompanied at any formal meeting or disciplinary hearing held under the procedure or work colleague.\\n\\nGAVS Technologies Pvt. Ltd. Proprietary and Confidential\\n\\nPage 3 of 8\\n\\nDisciplinary Process\\n\\nEquality and Diversity - To ensure fair treatment and, where appropriate, provision of support by GAVS in the application of this procedure, employees should be invited to provide information about any equality or diversity issues which may be relevant.\\n\\nConfidentiality – All parties involved in these procedures must ensure that they maintain, as appropriate, the confidentiality of the process within and outside GAVS.\\n\\nInvolvement of Human Resources - A member of the human resources team shall be part of the committee and the representative is consulted on suspension, investigation and formal procedure.\\n\\nTimescales - Whilst every endeavour will be made to comply with timescales, due to the complexity and or specific circumstances of cases, timescales may be extended. In such circumstances the employee will be advised of the reasons for any delay.\\n\\nInformal Procedure\\n\\nIt is part of the normal supervisory process that managers bring to the attention of the employees the standards required and any failure to meet those standards.\\n\\nCases of minor misconduct, (e.g. recurrent lateness) should be dealt with by the employee’s line manager/immediate supervisor/ BU Head / Functional Head (hereafter referred to as the manager) informally and without delay. The manager must speak to the employee, in private and should encourage them to conduct themselves in accordance with the required standards.\\n\\nThe purpose of these discussions is to ensure that the employee is given an opportunity to understand the nature of the concern, the sensitivity involved, areas of improvements in conduct, etc.\\n\\nIt is advisable to confirm the outcomes of any discussions in writing to the employee. The line manager should retain any note of these informal discussions or meetings.\\n\\nHowever, where an issue has been discussed with an employee informally and if:\\n\\n• •\\n\\nthe issue has not been resolved and the problem persists the required improvements in conduct are not achieved further information gets shared during discussions that can make the matter sufficiently serious the formal procedure should be invoked.\\n\\nFormal procedure\\n\\nWhere the informal process has not led to improved conduct, or where the alleged misconduct is of such seriousness that the manager considers informal action to be inappropriate, formal action will be initiated. Examples of misconduct are shown in Appendix A.\\n\\nGAVS Technologies Pvt. Ltd. Proprietary and Confidential\\n\\nPage 4 of 8\\n\\nDisciplinary Process\\n\\nAn investigation of the facts will be conducted as outlined in section 5 to determine whether there is a disciplinary case to answer.\\n\\nWhere an investigation indicates that there may have been an act of misconduct the employee will be required to attend a formal disciplinary hearing at which she/he shall be given the opportunity to respond and state his/her case.\\n\\nAuthority to take formal disciplinary action\\n\\nA disciplinary action committee is formed consisting of senior leadership team headed by the HR Head as appropriate.\\n\\nInvestigation\\n\\nBefore a disciplinary hearing is convened there will normally be an investigation into the circumstances of the alleged misconduct. The purpose of the investigation is to:\\n\\n▪ establish the nature of the allegations ▪ gather evidence to enable a decision to be taken on whether there is a disciplinary\\n\\ncase to answer\\n\\n▪ consider if the matter should proceed to a formal hearing\\n\\nThe employee will be informed promptly of any allegation and that an investigation to establish the facts will be undertaken. The investigation must be concluded as soon as reasonably possible whilst allowing sufficient time to interview relevant parties. Employees must be kept informed if there is any unexpected delay in the process.\\n\\nThe disciplinary committee would be immediately involved in the case to investigate the facts of the situation. A member of the HR team will assist in ensuring that the matters are handled fairly, reasonably and in compliance with current legislation and internal procedure.\\n\\nIf there is no disagreement concerning the facts of the case because the employee admits misconduct, an investigation may not be necessary before a disciplinary hearing is arranged. However, in cases where misconduct is not admitted or if there are conflicting views or evidence, further investigation will usually be appropriate before a decision is taken to proceed to a formal hearing.\\n\\nInvestigatory Interviews are part of the process to establish whether disciplinary action is warranted. As part of the investigation the employee who is the subject of the allegation will be asked to attend an investigatory interview at which she/he may be accompanied. The employee must inform the investigating manager of any facts or witnesses that she/he feels are relevant to the case. Where appropriate, witnesses will also be interviewed. Interview statements which are signed and dated will be produced.\\n\\nGAVS Technologies Pvt. Ltd. Proprietary and Confidential\\n\\nPage 5 of 8\\n\\nDisciplinary Process\\n\\nThe outcomes of an investigation may be:\\n\\nThere is no case to answer and therefore no disciplinary action is taken • Recommendation that there is a disciplinary case to answer and a disciplinary hearing should be arranged\\n\\nDisciplinary Hearing\\n\\nDisciplinary Hearing – Preparation and conduct\\n\\nIf following an investigation there is a recommendation that there is a disciplinary case to answer, the employee will normally be given minimum notice and invited to attend a disciplinary hearing. The employee will be provided with details of the allegation(s) and an indication as to whether the alleged misconduct is considered as potentially a serious/gross misconduct case and therefore whether a sanction less than or up to dismissal may be considered. The employee will be invited to make any written submissions or bring forward witnesses.\\n\\nThe employee will be given an opportunity to present his/her case, question witnesses and raise any issues she/he wishes to have considered. The manager conducting and hearing the case will be able to question those involved in the case.\\n\\nThe committee conducting and hearing the case will consider all representations then decide if on the balance of probabilities the allegation(s) are proven and if so what level of disciplinary sanction is appropriate.\\n\\nThe decision may be given verbally at the hearing and will in any event be conveyed or confirmed in writing within five working days of the hearing. The correspondence shall also notify the individual employee of his/her right to appeal against any sanction. In the event that the decision is taken to dismiss the employee, the letter will include the reasons for dismissal and the date that his/her employment will terminate, together with details of any notice arrangements.\\n\\nFormal Levels of Disciplinary Sanctions\\n\\nThe formal disciplinary procedure will be concluded with various sanctions dependent upon the gravity of the case and/or the on-going nature of the misconduct:\\n\\nWritten warning\\n\\nThis is usually given if there has been either a minor breach in conduct which remains unresolved by informal action, or a first more serious breach of discipline.\\n\\nThe disciplinary sanction of a written warning given will be retained on the employee’s personal file, subject to satisfactory conduct and/or improvements for twelve months from the date the decision is confirmed.\\n\\nGAVS Technologies Pvt. Ltd. Proprietary and Confidential\\n\\nPage 6 of 8\\n\\nDisciplinary Process\\n\\nFinal written warning\\n\\nIf the employee does not meet the required standard of conduct set out in the first warning letter or commits any other act of misconduct during the timescale of an existing warning, a further formal disciplinary hearing may be convened.\\n\\nIn some circumstances, where an alleged misconduct is sufficiently serious, it may be appropriate to progress straight to final written warning of this procedure.\\n\\nThe disciplinary hearing will be conducted following an investigation if appropriate and as described in section 6.1.\\n\\nThe disciplinary sanction of a final written warning will be retained on the employee’s personal file, subject to satisfactory conduct and or improvements for twenty-four months from the date the decision is confirmed.\\n\\nDismissal\\n\\nIf allegations are raised which are so serious as to constitute gross misconduct, such as those in Appendix A, it will be appropriate to consider formal action such as a dismissal under this procedure.\\n\\nIf an investigation indicates that an act of gross misconduct may have occurred, the employee will be required to attend a formal disciplinary hearing.\\n\\nThe letter requiring attendance at the formal disciplinary hearing shall include a statement of the alleged misconduct and warn the employee that one consequence of the hearing may be the termination of his/her employment with or without notice.\\n\\nThe disciplinary committee conducting and hearing case will consider all representations then decide if on the balance of probabilities the allegation(s) are proved and if so what level of disciplinary sanction, including and up to dismissal, is appropriate. On the basis of the information presented the committee may decide:\\n\\nTo dismiss the employee (without notice in the case of gross misconduct) • That there are insufficient grounds to dismiss the employee under this procedure; • On the imposition, extension or renewal of a warning or final written warning issued under this procedure;\\n\\nTo withhold an increment of salary • On the removal of any title or office held in addition to the substantive appointment • On the transfer of an employee abroad\\n\\nThe above list is not exhaustive, and the outcome may be varied according to the circumstances of the case.\\n\\nGAVS Technologies Pvt. Ltd. Proprietary and Confidential\\n\\nPage 7 of 8\\n\\nDisciplinary Process\\n\\nAppendix A: Examples of misconduct/gross misconduct\\n\\nExamples of Misconduct/Gross Misconduct\\n\\nThe following examples are not exhaustive but indicative of conduct that GAVS considers may warrant disciplinary action up to and including *summary dismissal in the case of gross misconduct:\\n\\nExamples of misconduct\\n\\nUnsatisfactory attendance at work e.g. unauthorized or unreported absence or persistent lateness\\n\\nMisuse of internet, email and other organization facilities • Refusing or failure to carry out a reasonable management instruction • Failure to comply with agreed working practices\\n\\nPersistent offences of misconduct may lead to the termination of employment.\\n\\nAny misconduct of a sufficiently serious nature may be deemed to be gross misconduct and dealt with accordingly. Examples of behaviour that may constitute gross misconduct are shown below. Again these examples are not exhaustive.\\n\\nExamples of gross misconduct\\n\\nData misrepesentation – such as falsification of personal data • Assault on another employee • Breach of Confidence – serious and/or persistent breaches of confidence • Dishonesty – Theft, fraud or falsification of records • Unlawful Discrimination – intentional unlawful discrimination or serious bullying and harassment of employee\\n\\nSummary dismissal - is dismissal for gross misconduct which takes immediate effect and there is no notice period or pay in lieu of notice given as a result of the dismissal.\\n\\nGAVS Technologies Pvt.

Hybrid architecture:\\n\\na. Serverless: Serverless cloud architecture is a paradigm that revolutionizes traditional approaches to application development and deployment. it is a better choice for applications that have unpredictable traffic patterns or require rapid scaling. Serverless computing is well suited for applications that are event-driven or have short, stateless execution times. Rather than paying for a fixed amount of server capacity, users are billed based on the actual compute resources consumed by their functions or applications.\\n\\nb. Serverful: Server-based computing, is responsible for managing the servers that run applications. This includes provisioning servers, managing operating system updates, scaling resources to meet demand, and ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.\\n\\n2. Flexibility and Scalability: Serverless platforms, such as AWS Lambda, automatically scale up or down based on the workload, ensuring that you only pay for what you use and your application can handle variable loads without manual intervention. This auto-scaling capability makes it easy to manage event-driven architectures and integrate with various services dynamically. On the other hand, traditional servers provide a stable environment for persistent services that require a constant presence, allowing for deep customization and optimization for specific workloads, which is crucial for applications with steady and predictable performance needs.\\n\\n3. Rapid Development: Rapid development is facilitated by serverless computing as it allows developers to focus solely on writing business logic without the overhead of thus speeding up development and deployment cycles. infrastructure management, serversful complement this by offering comprehensive toolsets and closely aligned development environments with production, reducing friction in the development pipeline and making it easier to handle more complex applications.\\n\\n4. Performance: Performance benefits are maximized by utilizing both serverless and serverful computing. Serverless functions are optimized for handling multiple concurrent executions efficiently, with the added advantage of reduced costs since you are not billed for idle time.

Hybrid architecture:\\n\\na. Serverless: Serverless cloud architecture is a paradigm that revolutionizes traditional approaches to application development and deployment. it is a better choice for applications that have unpredictable traffic patterns or require rapid scaling. Serverless computing is well suited for applications that are event-driven or have short, stateless execution times. Rather than paying for a fixed amount of server capacity, users are billed based on the actual compute resources consumed by their functions or applications.\\n\\nb. Serverful: Server-based computing, is responsible for managing the servers that run applications. This includes provisioning servers, managing operating system updates, scaling resources to meet demand, and ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.\\n\\n2. Flexibility and Scalability: Serverless platforms, such as AWS Lambda, automatically scale up or down based on the workload, ensuring that you only pay for what you use and your application can handle variable loads without manual intervention. This auto-scaling capability makes it easy to manage event-driven architectures and integrate with various services dynamically. On the other hand, traditional servers provide a stable environment for persistent services that require a constant presence, allowing for deep customization and optimization for specific workloads, which is crucial for applications with steady and predictable performance needs.\\n\\n3. Rapid Development: Rapid development is facilitated by serverless computing as it allows developers to focus solely on writing business logic without the overhead of thus speeding up development and deployment cycles. infrastructure management, serversful complement this by offering comprehensive toolsets and closely aligned development environments with production, reducing friction in the development pipeline and making it easier to handle more complex applications.\\n\\n4. Performance: Performance benefits are maximized by utilizing both serverless and serverful computing. Serverless functions are optimized for handling multiple concurrent executions efficiently, with the added advantage of reduced costs since you are not billed for idle time. This is particularly cost-effective for applications with sporadic traffic. Serverful minimizes latency for certain operations by eliminating the overhead that might be introduced by serverless architectures\\' cold starts, ensuring that performance remains high across different scenarios.\\n\\n5. Handling Unstructured Data: Products involve dealing with diverse and unstructured data, such as user-generated content or variable data types, combination of NoSQL and SQL databases are well-suited to handle this kind of data without the constraints of a rigid schema.\\n\\nThird party integrations\\n\\nLEI: The Global LEI Index is a global online source for open, standardized and high\\n\\nquality legal entity reference data.\\n\\nRefinitive: Refinitiv is an American-British global provider of financial market data and\\n\\ninfrastructure.\\n\\nSurvey Monkey: SurveyMonkey Inc. is an experience management company that offers cloud-based software for online survey development, and a suite of paid back-end programs\\n\\nAWS Services used as part of the solution\\n\\nAWS Service\\n\\nDescription\\n\\nAPI Gateway\\n\\nAPI Gateway allowed us to create stateful and stateless API without the need to code it, we only have to configure it. It also has integration for authentication which is coupled with cognito.\\n\\nLambda functions\\n\\nLambda lets us execute our code without any need to provision servers or containers. We just write the function and AWS takes responsibility to execute it. Also, we only pay for the time the function is being executed. We deployed distinct horizontal scaling without requiring additional effort from the development team.\\n\\ninstances of Lambda for each tenant, enabling seamless\\n\\nS3\\n\\nS3 serves static frontend components. Also it is used for storing other static data like users\\' profile and docs (if any) provided by the publishers.\\n\\nCognito\\n\\nCognito maintains users\\' authentication, authorization services which adhere to respective PII policies.\\n\\nidentity.\\n\\nIt acts as a single point\\n\\nfor providing\\n\\nDynamoDB\\n\\nDynamoDB is a NoSQL database. It is a key value based store. well-suited for agile development. Its flexible data models allow developers to quickly adapt to changing requirements without the need for extensive schema migrations, speeding up the development process. We established distinct DynamoDB tables for individual tenants, inherently ensuring both data isolation and the ability to scale horizontally.\\n\\nOpenSearch\\n\\nElastic-search helps in fast response of the data which is used frequently e.g. Listing pages, search, filter, sort, users configuration like preferred column order, filters, themes etc.\\n\\nRedShift\\n\\nData warehouse helps in assimilating and structuring data to be used for insights via visualization tools. This contains financial data and processed content from various external sources like social media and third party data\\n\\nproviders.\\n\\nQuickSight\\n\\nCreated insightful visualizations sourced from data residing in RedShift. QuickSight also has a very intuitive design and can be embedded within existing application user interfaces with ease.\\n\\nSQS\\n\\nFully managed message queuing for microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. Helped us to efficiently execute async jobs, without losing data.\\n\\nSNS\\n\\nAmazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) sends notifications, provides messaging between distributed systems, microservices, and event-driven serverless applications including SQS, Lambda and email.\\n\\nCode Pipeline\\n\\nAWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous delivery service that helps us automate our fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates. It helped us with rapid release of new features, iterating on feedback and catching bugs by testing each code change.\\n\\nrelease pipelines for\\n\\nEKS\\n\\nA fully managed Kubernetes service, simplifying cluster management and operations.
